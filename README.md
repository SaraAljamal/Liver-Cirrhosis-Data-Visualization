# Liver-Cirrhosis-Data-Visualization
A data visualization project using R to explore a liver cirrhosis dataset. This project features static and interactive visualizations to uncover key patterns and insights, helping to tell the story of the data.

_**Problem Statement**_

Liver cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease that can lead to severe health complications. The goal of this project is to visualize data related to liver cirrhosis in order to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help better understand the condition. Through data visualization, we aim to present the information in an intuitive way that tells the story behind the data, making it accessible for analysis and decision-making.

_**Dataset**_

The dataset contains 25,000 observations and 19 features, providing a comprehensive view of liver cirrhosis progression.

_**Project Workflow**_
1. Data Preprocessing:
   
•	Cleaned the dataset as needed.

•	Converted categorical variables into factors as needed for visualization.

2.  Static Visualizations:
    
•	Created static visualizations using ggplot2

3. Interactive Visualizations:
   
•	Developed interactive visualizations using libraries like Plotly and Shiny to allow users to explore the data dynamically.

4.  Results Interpretation:
   
•	Analyzed and interpreted the visualizations to provide insights into the factors affecting liver cirrhosis, where the key findings were included in the project’s report

_**Tech Stack**_
- R: Programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
- ggplot2: For creating static visualizations.
- plotly: For developing interactive visualizations.
- dplyr: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- shiny: For building interactive web applications.
- RStudio: Integrated development environment for R.

_**How to Use**_
1.	R Files:
- Upload the R files to your R environment.
- Run each script in RStudio to generate the corresponding visualizations.
2.	Liver Cirrhosis Report.:
- The (Liver Cirrhosis Report.docx) file discusses concepts in data visualization and provides a detailed review of each of the 15 plots highlighting the visualization rules and the insight of each one.
